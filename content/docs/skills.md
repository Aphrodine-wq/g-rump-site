Skills teach the AI agent specific workflows and domain knowledge via SKILL.md files. Each skill is a structured markdown file that gets injected into the system prompt when enabled.

## How Skills Work

When enabled, a skill's content is injected into the system prompt, giving the agent specialized knowledge for tasks like SwiftUI development, code review, or Kubernetes deployment. Skills include a persona, core expertise, patterns, best practices, anti-patterns, and verification criteria.

## Skill Locations

| Scope | Path | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| **Built-in** | `Sources/GRump/Resources/Skills/` | Bundled with app |
| **Global** | `~/.grump/skills/` | Available in all projects |
| **Project** | `.grump/skills/` | Project-specific |

## SKILL.md Format

Every skill follows the elite template:

```markdown
---
name: Skill Name
description: One-line description of what this skill enables.
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---

You are an expert [role] who [specializes in what].

## Core Expertise
- Bullet list of domain knowledge areas

## Patterns & Workflow
1. **Step** — Description of each step in the workflow

## Best Practices
- Actionable guidelines for high-quality work

## Anti-Patterns
- Common mistakes to avoid with explanation of why

## Verification
- Checkable criteria to confirm work quality

## Examples
- **Scenario**: Concrete example showing the skill in action
```

## ClawHub

ClawHub is a shared skill registry between G-Rump and OpenClaw. Skills installed via ClawHub are stored in `~/.grump/skills/` and accessible from both systems.

Browse and manage hub skills in **Settings → Workspace → Skills → ClawHub**.

## Managing Skills

- **Settings → Workspace → Skills** — Toggle skills on/off, add/edit/remove
- Skills can be enabled/disabled per-conversation via workflow presets
- The agent sees only enabled skills in its system prompt
- Meta-skills (combos) activate multiple skills simultaneously for complex workflows
